Que1 : What is JavaScript ? What is the roll of JavaScript engine?
Ans : Js is programming language that is use to convert static web pages into dynamic or interective web pages
the code send ny the browser is converted by the js engine that is available in all web browser for example
crome has V8 engine
Firefox has spider monkey
Safari has JS core 
edge has chakra

jS engine is a program present in web browser that execute javascript code.

Que2 : What are client side and server side?
Client : It is a device, application or software that requests and consumes services or resources from a server 
Server : It is a device sofware or application that provides service resources or function to the client

Que3: what are varibales ? What is the difference between let, const and var keyword ? 
Ans: Variable are the container use to store the variable, there are three types of variable in js 
var : var creates a functional scoped variable 
let : let creates a local scope variable 
const : it is also local scoped but varibale defined with const can not be reasigned a value
all variable in js is hoisted but let and const lies in temporary dead zone and also in case of variable only variable declaration is hoisted not initialization

Que4: What are some important string operation in JS ?
Ans: str.length , str.replace,str.includes,str.replaceAll,str.firstIndexOf,str.lastIndexof,str.charAt,str.charCodeAt,str.toLowerCase,str.toUpperCase,str.splice,str.splice,str.trim,str.remove,str.repeat,str.padstart,str.padEnd

Que5: Whta is HOF ?
Ans: HIgher Order Functios are the function that takes another function as the argument or return a function some example fo higher order function are Map, Filter and Reduce

Que6: What is DOM ? What is the Difference between HTML and DOM ?
Ans: DOM represents the web page as a tree-like structure of HTML that allows javascript to access and manipulate the content and the structure of the web page, HTML is just the static representation of the web content, the memory plays with the DOM to make access and manipulate web content 
HTML Is static representation of the webpage
DOM is the interface to make the static web page dynamic with the help of js

Que7: What are Selector in JS ?
Ans: Selector in JS helps to access the html element from DOM with the help of id selector class selector , element selector ,query selector

Que8: What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClass, getElementsByTagName ?
Ans: All three are the selector used in js to access and manipulate the content of the web page , 
getElementById : Use To get the element with the help of Id given to the element and has only one
getElementsByClass :  Use To get the element with the help of class given to the element and can be multiple
getElementsByTagName : Use To get the element with the help of tagName of the element and can be multiple

Que9: Js is implicit language How ?
Ans: Js is implicit language as it sometimes shows implicit behaviour like type coercion and variable declaration.Js sometimes tries to predict what we are trying to do which can lead to unexpected behaviour when not handled correctly
like 
1. type coercion console.log("5" + 3);  // Output: "53" (number 3 is coerced to a string)
console.log("5" - 3);  // Output: 2 (string "5" is coerced to a number)
2. implicit global variable: when we defined a varibale with using const, let and var declaration js declare it as global variable
3. Function argument : JavaScript allows a function to call with more or fewer argument than declare which can lead implicit value life Undefined
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5));    // Output: NaN (b is implicitly `undefined`, so 5 + undefined)
This implicit behavior makes JavaScript more flexible but requires caution when writing code, especially for beginners.
 
Que10: What are Data types in JS ?
Ans: A data type determines the type of a variable,in JavaScript there are two types of Data type Primitive and Non Primitive
Primitive Data Type : Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol  (only one value can assign in primitive data type in one time)
Non Primitive Data Type : Oject, Array, Function, Date, RegExp  (multiple values can be assign in non primitive data type in one time)


Que11: What are operators ? What are the types of operators in JS ?
Ans: Operators are the Symbol or keyword used to perform operations on operands
Types of Oprators : Arithmetic, Assignment, Logical, Comparision,String(+ OPEAROR THAT IS USED TO CONCATE TWO STRINGS)

Que12: What are the types of conditions statement in JS ?
Ans: if/else, Ternary operator, Switch statement

Que13: What is loop ? What are the type of loop in JS ?
Ans: A loop is a programming way to run a piece of code repeatedly untill a certain consition is meet
Type of loop in JS : For, while, do while, for of, for in 

Que14: What are Functions in JS ? What are the types of function ? 
Ans: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task, in the program function is defined once and can be used any where and any number of time in the program
Type of function in JS : Named Function, Function expression, Function Declaration, Arrow Function, IIFE, CallBack, Higher Order Function

Que15: What are Arrow Functions in JS ? What is its use ?
Ans: Arrow function is the shorthand syntax to write function in the js, previously arrpw function were known as fat arrow function


// QUESTIONS RELATED TO OBJECT
Que1: How do you create an object using an object literal?
Ans: An object can be defined using key value pair separted by , inside curly braces a object can store another object, array and other data types,
const obj = {
    "Name":"Jyoti",
    "age":21,
    "array":["apple","mango","potato",2,5],
   "innerObj" :{
    "LastName" :"Markun",
    "profession":"Developer"
   }
};

Que2: How do you create an object using a constructor function?
Ans: An object can be created using object constructor thta already exist in JS it can either be created using new keyword before Object()constructor or with new keyword
const obj2 = new Object() // create empty object preferre this
const obj1 = Object() // also create empty object
const obj3 ={} // best method to create object

// NON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE ALSO CALLED REFERENCE TYPE AND PRIMITIVE IS CALLED VALUE TYPE
NON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE : OBJECT
OBJECT ARE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO THREE CATEGORY
Object Literals
Function
Arrays

objects are called REFERENCE type here when we compare two object only it address is compared not the value as they can contain multiple values

Que3: What is the purpose of the Object() constructor? How is it different from object literals?
Ans: Object() constructor is javascript in-built constructor to create objects in js , if we want to create new objet from constructor function we need to call it with new Object() or Object(), after creating object usung Object() constructor we need to add properties to it manually
const obj = new Object()
obj1.name = "jyoti";
console.log(obj1)
console.log(obj1.name)

object literal are more simple way to create an object in js usually a object is created using this method only 
const obj = {
    "Name":"Jyoti",
    "age":21,
    "array":["apple","mango","potato",2,5],
   "innerObj" :{
    "LastName" :"Markun",
    "profession":"Developer"
   }
};

Que4: How can you create an object using the Object.create() method? What is the benefit of using this approach?
Ans: Object.create() method takes an existing object as the first argument and makes a new object from it and the new created has all the property of the object from which it is created in its prototype and also we can add o=new properties to prototype of the new object

const personPrototype = {
    greet(){
        console.log(`Hii, My name is ${this.name}`);
    }
};

const childObj = Object.create(personPrototype)
childObj.name = "jyoti"
console.log(childObj)
childObj.greet();

const childObj2 = Object.create(personPrototype,{
name:{value:"jyoti",writable:true},
age:{value:25,writable:true}
})
console.log(childObj2)
childObj2.name="Markun"
console.log(childObj2)

Que: How do you add a property to an object after it has been created?
Ans : We can add property to an object after it has been created by using dot notion 
we first need to write object name then . or [] notation and then name of the property we wanna add and assign value to it 
const obj = {}
obj.name = "jyoti"
obj["last-name"] ="markun"

we use dot notation when we have key name simple and it does not involve any special character or Symbol
use square notation when we wanna make name with special character and inside the square barcket key name should be wrapped in quote


Que: How do you delete a property from an object?
Ans: To deleet a property from an object we use delete operator. delete operator delete the property from an object if it exist if it does not exist it does not through an error, we can delete property from an object using dot as well as square bracket notation

const obj3 = {
    name:"jyoti",
    age:26,
    lastName: "Markun",
   "profession@":"developer"
}

console.log(obj3);
console.log("lastName" in obj3);

delete obj3.lastName;
console.log(obj3);
console.log("lastName" in obj3);

delete obj3["profession@"]
console.log(obj3);
console.log("lastName" in obj3);
